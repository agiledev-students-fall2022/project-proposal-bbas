# Project Proposal

## Collaborators:
Ben Schwartz, Abigail Zhou, Brandon Somoza, Shay Gyawali

## Project title:
Finderskeepers

## What and why?
Have you ever procrastinated until the last second, or have forgotten a homework that requires you to print something last minute? In comes finderskeepers, an application which allows you to find a variety of resources nearby or near a specific location such as a school. This application is useful for students (and really anyone) who may not have access to necessities such as wifi, printers, computers, or even just a quiet place to study for a couple of hours that isn't your room. 

## Some important features that will be included:
- There will be a system similar to yelp, in that businesses or places can recieve ratings by students based on the services they provide. 
- Ideally there will be a space for students and for teachers/schools on the app. A person can log in as a student or teacher, and depending on your role, you will have different options. 

## Scope:
We believe the app to be accomplishable by the end of the semester. We will be using technologies wildly available to make the task easier in a sense, such as api's and web scraping. There will be a set number of resources we can include and this number will be clearer as we being to make progress on the app.
