## Title
Study Buddy

## The Problem
Across the United States, millions of students struggle to complete their schoolwork due to not being able to find or access the resources they need to succeed. This can stem from economic/circumstantial hardship, learning disabilities, or simply a lack of time management skills (which can lead to the stressful task of trying to find a printer two minutes before class starts).

## The Solution
*Study Buddy* is a way for students to ensure they can always find the resources they need with just a quick search. The app will be a hub for finding organizations that provide services like computer/internet usage, printing, copying, etc. Organizations will also be able to "claim" their profiles to provide a more accurate description of their services.

For educators, both schools and teachers will be able to create custom lists of recommended organizations for students. They will also be able to select the types of resources students will need for their course(s), which students will then be able to use to find nearby organizations that provide them.

As an ancillary benefit of *Study Buddy*, it will also allow students to share their experiences with the resources in each organization through a rating system. They'll be able to leave their comments along with a like or dislike. Another great feature of the rating system will be the ability for students to assign tags to their rating so that the organization can be found by those tags as well as the resources they provide. This system will encourage organizations to respond by using student feedback to improve the resources they offer.

## Realistic?
Our group concurs that *Study Buddy*'s scope will be appropriate for the timeline of the semester. There is no usage of advanced graphics or creation of intricate artifacts. Finding organization data can be automated by processes such as web scraping or using existing APIs. These factors automate the process such that it will save a lot of time.
